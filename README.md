# MelonKami Bot Experimental

This repo is for the Experimental version of my main bot MelonKami, here I will experiment on features and ect.

## Important Notes

* As of now, there are no important notes, if you have any questions check `Configuration notes`, if you can't find your question answer there, you can create an issue on the repo

## Configuration notes
  
* Want to change something in the configuration file? The configuration file is the file that stores data for the bot, for example your token and prefix is stored there, now if you inputted the wrong token or prefix, you can head over to ``config.json`` and change what you need there. You should turn off the bot when doing this to:

1. Not generate error

2. Not overwrite what has been changed: the bot won't recognize a change, and it could potentially overwrite your change if it is running
